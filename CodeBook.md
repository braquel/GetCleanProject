Code Book : Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

Data sets used in this project came from the study "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"[1]. The study revolved around measuring acceleration and velocity of test participants while doing "activities of daily living (ADL)". In line with developing wearable technology, the study used a smartphone with a built in sensors to measure & transmit data while attached to the test participants. The received data from the accelerometer and gyroscope of Samsung S II were further subjected to filters to arrive at the final measurements refered to as 'features' collated into the data sets. The study focused on the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. For further information on the study, visit the following links:
